# IdReactBox

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). All functionality with `create-react-app` is baked in to the cake.

A simple CRUD application built out using React and Rails API backend. To simplify the process, the Rails API is embedded in the project and run on a separate server. This allows the simulation of hitting an external API to practice `async/ await` patterns and the ability to slow down or speed up the response time.
